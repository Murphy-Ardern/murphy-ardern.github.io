        <h4>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h4>
            <a>I learned a lot about myself during this course. I learned a lot about my ability to study and my motivation, a lot about how I take in and regurgitate information and generally how to study and learn more efficiently</a>
        <h4>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
            <a>all of these play a part in programming because you are required to spend a lot of time with others and yourself. In order to be good to others and to yourself practicing a combination of these values is key.</a>
        <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
            <a>The amount of value and general insight I got with it, as well as the overall ability to be more self aware. It helped greatly in learning to learn.</a>
        <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>\
            <a>The aspects that required introspection were challenging because it forced me to look inwards and learn from myself.</a>
        <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development
            Bootcamp course?</h4>
            <a>I think it's important because taking time to learn about the self and learning is important to maintaining yourself in your time within dev academy and in other areas.</a>
        <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time
            to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>
            <a>I think this added a lot of balance to the course and in a lot of ways reduced the strain of having to spend a whole day coding, as well as being generally beneficial learning.</a>
