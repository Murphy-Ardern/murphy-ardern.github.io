<h1>Learning Plan</h1>
<h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
<p>
  My long term goal is to apply the knowledge from my time at Dev Academy and get a job in the development scene, eventually reaching a point where I can afford to live comfortably and take care of my family.
</p>

<h3>My strengths in learning:</h3>
<p>
  Tenacity, I will keep persisting towards a goal even if I struggle or take a long time to do it. I see failure as an opportunity to grow and improve.
  Willingness to learn new things, I love new information and learning anything new is always rewarding.
</p>

<h3>Weaknesses in learning:</h3>
<p>
  I never feel as though what I have done is enough, even if I put my best into something I regularly struggle with feeling my work is inadeqate.
</p>

<h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>

<p>
  The thing I would like to learn most is management of time and effort. At the moment I struggle to apply even amounts of effort over a period of time. I tend to get a lot of my work done in short bursts. The issue with this method 
  of working is that sometimes that energy isn't there and I find myself having to really push to get anything done. Ideally I would like to learn to overcome this and either learn to manage my style of learning better or find another way to work.
</p>

<h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. 
<p>
  What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?  
  A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
</p>

<p>
  I will manage myself by setting a block of time each day aside for work each day rather than spontaneous bursts of effort. This will help with consistency of my own work and improve the quality. I will maintain communication with the course facilitators and others in my cohort 
  When things build up and it starts to emotionally effect me, I like to go talk to someone about it, whether that be a facilitator within dev academy or a friend or family member, sometimes all that it takes to feel better when things get overwhelming is to stop and talk.
  I have my homegroup and group facilitator to talk to on discord should anything go wrong. 
</p>

<h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>

<p>
  My expectations for the facilitation team are to help when help is needed and to be kind and patient when doing so.
</p>

I have no other commitments outside of Dev Academy (ideally this means all my work gets done asap)
