      <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
      Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain's neural networks to adapt and change through growth. Change can range from an individual neuron pathway making a new connection to huge new adjustments.
      neuroplasticity is a trait that was thought to be present in the brains of children only, but was later discovered to be present in adults as well, although fully-developed brains take longer to adapt and make changes to neural pathways. 

      <h3>Types of Neuroplasticity</h3>

      <h4>Structural Neuroplasticity</h4>
      <p>As the name suggests, structural neuroplasticity is how the structure of the brain changes over time. This is a far more neuroscience related field but the brain is known to change its neural connections. Structural neuroplasticity is primarily the change in 
      proportion of grey matter and the synaptic strength of the brain.</p>

      <h4>Functional Neuroplasticity</h4>
      <p>Functional neuroplasticity is the brain changing the properties of its own neurons. This can allow for adaptations and the ability to learn in a mulitiude of different situations.</p>
      
      <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/neuroplasticity">here</a> is a resource I found helpful when learning about neuroplasticity.



      <h3>Growth mindset</h3>
     <p>A growth mindset is the idea that intelligence is not a static thing. You cannot be smart or dumb, you can develop intelligence through multiple methods.</p> 

      <p>A growth mindset entails approaching things positively. It requires that you embrace change and look for an opportunity to grow and adapt from it. Growth also requires that you persist when things become difficult, that you put effort in knowing that you will be rewarded for it,
      and that you learn from criticism. Having these ideals in mind helps with learning exponentially, when you are open to growth you will grow much more quickly whereas if you do not want to embrace change and grow, you will find it much more difficult to get anywhere.
      Having the ability to believe that you are not static and that you can grow and learn from adversity is ultimately key to doing just that, growing and learning as a person.</p>
