        <h1>Problem Solving</h1>

    <h4> Times where I was:</h4>
        <p> 1. blocked on a simple problem:</p>
        <p>I got stuck a few times on very simple errors, like syntax within the code being slightly wrong and it would take
            me a long time to figure out the small issue.</p>

        <h5> what problem-solving techniques did you use?</h5>
        <p>I took a step back to look at the bigger picture and figure out what in the code was wrong. Eventually I looked
            on google to find what I needed.</p>
        <h5>how did you feel throughout the process? </h5>
            <p>I was frustrated that such small errors could be such a big setback and relieved when I finally solved the issue.</p>
        
        <h5> what did you learn?</h5>
            sometimes stepping back to look at the bigger picture of the code can help identify errors.
    <h4>2. elegantly solved a problem.</h4>
        <h5>what was the problem?</h5>
            <p>Using the same way of problem solving as last time I had some issues with how parts of my code were performing. I
            stepped back and took a look at the bigger picture to see what was wrong and how to adjust it.</p>
        <h5>how did you feel throughout the process?</h5>
            <p>I felt stepping away made me feel a little more collected about how I was looking at the problem</p>
        <h5>what did you learn?</h5>
            <p>Changing perspectives can help understand code.</h5>
    <h4>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h4>
        <h5>Pseudocode</h5>
            <a>I am confident in using pseudocode especially because it helps me with planning code in future.</a>
        <h5>Trying something</h5>
            <a>I love just trying something. Very confident.</a>
        <h5>Rubber ducky method</h5>
            <a>I like the rubber ducky method a lot because it helps me understand and make sense of code as it is written.</a>
        <h5>Reading error messages</h5>
            <a>Reading error messages are simple and quick, if it still doesn't help I search for things related to the error message.</a>
        <h5>Console.logging</h5>
            <a>Console logging is simple and easy. It helps with a lot of situations</a>
        <h5>Googling</h5>
            <a>I am always confident in googling.</a>
        <h5>Asking your peers for help</h5>
            <a>More recently I have become a lot more comfortable with asking people for help. I am at least partially confident</a>
        <h5>Asking coaches for help</h5>
            <a>If I ever have a problem I can't solve on my own I am confident in going to coaches.</a>
        <h5>Improving your process with reflection</h5>
            <a>I think reflection is always helpful and it helps me see what I could do better or differently next time</a>
